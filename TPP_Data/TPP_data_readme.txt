This folder contains the data files used for the development of this model. The data is available on Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores) and was downloaded and unzipped in a folder called 
KaggleFootballData.

I rearranged the data in the files with pandas and put the resulting dataframes in TPP_ProcessedDatasets. If you
want to recreate the results, you'll have to make KaggleFootballData an TPP_ProcessedData here. They are not huge
but bigger than Github maximum sizes.

Happy coding, and feel free to contact if you have any troubles.
